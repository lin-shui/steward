"""The twin in the chores kitchen: the coloured bowls on a table its two fixed arms can reach.

The chores kitchen is built for a mobile robot that drives to a sideboard and a cabinet. This
scene keeps the tableware and drops the mobile base, so what is under test is that the layout sits
inside the twin's reachable tabletop band and that the nesting mission really stacks the bowls.
