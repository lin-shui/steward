# Steward

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The robot Ego Harness can use the `rgbd_video_gen` and `NovelAnything` skills for remote novel-view synthesis. `scripts/setup-dsh-profiles.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `scripts/setup-dsh-profiles.ps1` (Windows) install both into the robot profile; on Windows, `scripts/setup-rgbd-video-gen.ps1` and `scripts/setup-novelanything.ps1` add them to an existing one. See the [rgbd_video_gen guide](dsh/packages/dsh-bundle-rgbd-video-gen/README.md) and [NovelAnything guide](dsh/packages/dsh-bundle-novelanything/README.md).

Model evidence uses the existing `head_camera`. Continuous recording samples in simulation time with measured robot odometry and encoders; target gripper views use robot-owned forward kinematics. Snapshots retain the head/wide cameras and their individual calibration, layout, field of view and perception responsibilities. These capabilities do not install SLARM or extra cameras.

See the [perception model skills guide](docs/novel-view-generation/README.md) for copyable robot prompts, camera conventions and package responsibilities.

Steward is an embodied robotics system built on DeepSeek Harness. See [steward.md](../steward.md) for the design, its “13. Implementation Progress” section for progress and launch commands, and [13.7](../steward.md#137-phase-1-感知方法与泛化) for Phase 1 RGB-D geometry, classification and generalization.

## Quick start

```sh
uv sync
.venv/bin/steward demo          # 构建厨房并运行「把杯子放到桌上」，按 World State 判定成败
.venv/bin/steward up --scenario phase0-shuttle --no-dispatch-task   # 常驻运行世界与机器人，搬运交给下面的 shuttle
open http://127.0.0.1:7400/console   # 浏览器控制台：斜视主视图、相机、地图、指标、控制
.venv/bin/steward shuttle --api http://127.0.0.1:7420 --steps 0   # 在餐桌、柜子、餐边柜之间循环搬运
./scripts/check.sh              # Python 测试、DSH 插件编译与测试、组合配置快照比对
.venv/bin/steward build-kitchen # 机器人模型改动后（如头部加装的广角相机）重建默认场景
```

Focus either preview with a click or Tab: WASD moves the shared view horizontally, Shift accelerates, dragging turns in place, and scrolling zooms. Release the keys, leave the preview or press Escape to stop. Presets recenter the view. These controls do not move the robot or its sensor cameras.

The robot has two head RGB-D cameras: `head_camera` looks ahead; the short-focal-length `wide_camera` sees the nearby worktop and gripper. Both contribute to perception; see [steward.md 13.8](../steward.md#138-机器人本体的双相机).

The `cobot-magic` arms start with joint1–joint6 at zero radians and their fingers open. The `cobot-magic` grippers use simplified palm, guide, slider and finger geometry. Their fingers extend along the tool axis and open symmetrically to a 100 mm inner aperture; the grasp point lies between the pads, 5 mm behind the tips. These visual primitives are not manufacturer CAD or contact-based gripping.

The `cobot-magic` arm/lift geometry follows manufacturer `robot.usd`; the [embodiment profile](embodiments/cobot-magic.yaml) records coordinate mappings, unit assumptions and retained simulation approximations. Runtime assets come from `src/steward/assets/cobot.py`, not the descriptive YAML. See the [migration guide](../docs/upgrade-guide/v0.2.2-alpha.2/cobot-lift-coordinates/guide.md) for saved scenes and raw lift commands.

AgileX preserves its arm posture until docking succeeds. Placement checks the required wrist orientation and IK continuity from measured joints; these checks do not replace full collision or dynamics planning. After successful work, both empty arms return their six joints to zero before the job completes, leaving lift and fingers unchanged. A held object or handle prevents homing; failures and cancellation do not initiate it. Homing failures are reported separately from the completed action.

Passing `--misnames-config ''` disables name mappings. A switch to `phase0-misnamed` without a mapping is rejected, and the running world and later episodes retain the previous phase.

## Run with DeepSeek Harness

```sh
echo 'DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...' > .env     # 已被 Git 忽略，运行脚本自动加载
.venv/bin/steward up                      # WCA :7400，机器人端口 :7410，Ego API :7420；场景任务自动交给 Ego Harness
.venv/bin/steward up --phase phase1-sam   # 机器人用 SAM 3.1 自行分割 RGB-D（设置在 config/segmentation.toml）
./scripts/setup-dsh-profiles.sh           # 构建插件，创建 ego、world、world-task profile
./scripts/run-ego.sh "把杯子放到桌上"       # 机器人智能体
./scripts/run-world.sh "按描述构建一间厨房……"  # World Harness 一次性任务
./scripts/run-world.sh --port 3091        # World Harness 浏览器界面
./scripts/install-desktop-app.sh          # 在桌面安装 Steward.app：选场景后启动世界、Ego Harness 并打开控制台
.venv/bin/steward services                # 检查远程感知服务（SAM 3.1、NovelAnything、NVS、SLARM）是否可达
```

## Windows

Steward runs on Windows with the same commands: `uv sync` installs the `steward` executable under `.venv\Scripts`, and every `.sh` script has a PowerShell counterpart with the same name and arguments. If PowerShell refuses unsigned scripts, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.

```powershell
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\steward up --phase phase1-sam
.\scripts\setup-dsh-profiles.ps1          # 构建插件，创建 ego、world、world-task profile
.\scripts\run-ego.ps1 "把杯子放到桌上"      # 机器人智能体
.\scripts\run-world.ps1 --port 3091       # World Harness 浏览器界面
.\scripts\check.ps1                       # Python 测试、DSH 插件编译与测试、组合配置快照比对
.\scripts\install-desktop-app.ps1         # 在桌面创建 Steward 快捷方式：选场景后启动世界、Ego Harness 并打开控制台
```

The desktop launcher writes its logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Steward\Logs`; on macOS they go to `~/Library/Logs/Steward`.

The robot `ego` profile observes and acts through the Ego API; general shell, file and web tools are disabled. The `world` and `world-task` profiles use the World Control API for assets, scenes and episodes. Robot and World Harnesses use separate `DSH_HOME` directories.
