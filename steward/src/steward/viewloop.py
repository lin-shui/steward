"""Frame-clocked view rendering on a dedicated thread.

A console view (the World State view in the Steward host, the Ego-State view on the robot) renders
on its own thread with its own OpenGL resources, never on a simulation, estimation or request
thread. Views in different processes stay in step through :class:`FrameClock` alone: frame ``k``
falls at ``k / fps`` seconds of Unix time, so renderers told the same rate render at the same
instants without exchanging messages (separate hosts keep their clocks in step with NTP or PTP).
A renderer that cannot finish a frame within one tick skips to the next tick instead of drifting.
