"""Scripted chores over the Ego API, repeated round after round.

One round has three phases:

1. **table**: the tableware (bowls, wine glass, mug) stands in one row on the dining table,
   ordered from the smallest to the largest footprint;
2. **sideboard**: the tableware moves to the sideboard top; bowls nest largest to smallest in
   one stack, the other pieces stand in a row beside it (pieces already in place stay);
3. **drawers**: both drawers are opened, the contents of the sideboard drawer and the cabinet
   drawer are exchanged, and both drawers are closed.

Everything is located in the Ego-State by role (the scene-level reading of each object's category), colour and estimated size; placements use
explicit offsets in the support's own frame, and every motion goes through a Prediction Receipt.
