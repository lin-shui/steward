"""The Cobot Magic twin's Ego Runtime as a process of its own.

Everything the twin knows arrives through its robot port: encoders and gripper states, the
head cameras' RGB-D frames (or labelled detections at phase 0), and the effect of the joint
commands it sends. The belief, the skills and the scenario's scripted mission run here, and the
Ego API serves the belief to the console -- the same shape as the mobile robot's
:class:`~steward.ego.runtime.EgoRuntime`, which is what lets `steward up` put either body behind
a scenario.

A round of the mission ends with the arms parked, and the world decides when the next one
starts: an episode reset (the console's 重置, or loading the scenario again) changes the episode
number of the robot's readings, which the runtime reads as a reboot -- it forgets its belief and
looks again. A reset that
lands in the middle of a round is caught the same way: the round ends however it ends, and the
next one starts at once. The runtime never edits the world; in `steward cobot` the round driver
teleports the tableware home itself, here that is the operator's reset.
