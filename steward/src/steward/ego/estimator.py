"""Ego-State estimation: fuse detections into robot-owned object tracks and publish the ES.

Each detection is transformed from the camera mount frame into the robot's ``map`` frame with
the robot's own odometry and body model, associated to an existing track (nearest compatible
category within a gate) and fused with a per-axis Kalman update, so position variance shrinks
as observations accumulate. Unmatched detections start new tracks with robot-assigned ``e:``
ids. A track that should have been visible but was not detected loses existence probability
and is dropped below a threshold.

Phase 0 assumption: the ``map`` frame coincides with the world frame because odometry is
nearly ideal; the Observer still estimates the alignment explicitly.
