"""ESim (Phase 0): consequence prediction over the Ego-State, producing Prediction Receipts.

Phase 0 ESim is geometric and probabilistic rather than a physics rollout: it plans the exact
motion the skill would execute, checks the robot footprint and path against ES obstacles, and
converts ES uncertainty into a risk score (for example the probability that the gripper misses
a target whose position is uncertain). The receipt carries that plan; running a receipt executes
the predicted plan, not a fresh one. Physics rollouts with belief sampling arrive in Phase 2.
